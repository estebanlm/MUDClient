# RPGClient

A client to play MUDs (The ones I play :P), made in [Pharo](http://pharo.org).

It implements several features:

- A complete Telnet client
- Parsers for common telnet protocols: ANSI, ...
- Parsers for MUD telnet protocols: MSDP, ...

For now, license is [GPL3](LICENSE.txt) (but I'm just starting to play with is so there is no much to see)
