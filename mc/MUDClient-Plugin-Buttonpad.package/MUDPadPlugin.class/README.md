I'm a pad plugin. I define different pads, that can be keystroke related (like alt+1... alt+0 definitions), but I also can define "generic" pads: matrices that can be triggered as buttons. The key related pads does not need explanation: they are like any other command trigger and are commonly used to trigger combat options. The generic are more meant to change attitudes or posses, for example, tones.

"tone none" "tone curious"

etc. The idea is to help a fast choosing of role options.
