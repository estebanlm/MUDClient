I'm a plugin to handle aliases. 
I can translate a defined input into a sequeance of commands. I accept also variables definitons.

Some examples of I what I can do:

alias1 -> trigger1 
alias2 -> trigger1 trigger2 trigger3

$var1=something
alias3 -> trigger1 $var

At the moment I cannot handle parameters, but that will change soon :)
